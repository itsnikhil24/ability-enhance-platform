# ü•ÅIntroduction

### Introduction  

Our platform is designed to enhance cognitive abilities by providing personalized learning experiences. It empowers users to identify their specific disabilities and take an ability test to assess the severity. Based on the results, tailored courses and mentor recommendations are offered to help users work on their challenges effectively.  

Additionally, the platform features an AI chatbot for users to ask questions related to their disabilities or seek relevant references. To encourage consistent growth, daily tasks or "problems of the day" are provided, fostering exponential improvement. Users can track their progress through streaks and graphical representations, ensuring a motivating and insightful learning journey.  

This edutech solution aims to bridge the gap between cognitive challenges and effective learning strategies, creating an inclusive environment for all users.
